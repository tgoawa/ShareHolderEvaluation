    <p>As discussed during the summit and subsequent meetings, the firm WIGs are: #1 Growth; #2 Build and Bring Expertise; and #3 Culture/trust. Below you will be asked to choose a Sub WIG and its corresponding WIG. WIGs, as with competencies and leadership goals, are the behaviors that need to take place in order for us to achieve our desired economic goals.  Please see the guidebook for examples of each WIG and the Sub-WIGs. To add a goal, click on the green “Add Goal” in the Goals box below and choose the weight you want to assign to this goal.  Next, add your goal detail by click on the blue WIG goal text.  If applicable, use the drop down arrow to choose an Industry Team and/or a Service Line in which this goal applies.  Describe the goal using the SMART methodology– Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic and Timely; or, the X to Y by when.  See the guidebook for details on creating goals.  Add specific actions that you need to take in order for you to achieve your goal.</p>
