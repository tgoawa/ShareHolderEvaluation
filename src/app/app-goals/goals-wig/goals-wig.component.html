    <p>As discussed during the summit and subsequent meetings, the firm WIGs are: #1 Growth; #2 Build and Bring Expertise; and
      #3 One-firm culture built on trust, execution and accountability. WIGs, as with competencies and leadership goals,
      are the behaviors that need to take place in order for us to achieve our desired economic goals. Please see the guidebook
      for examples of each WIG and its corresponding firm battles. To add a goal, click on the green “Add Goal” in the Goals
      box below. To the right of the Goals box, is where you will add “Goal Details.” Use the drop down arrow to choose the
      WIG your goal will align with, an Industry Team and/or a Service Line in which this goal applies (if applicable), give
      it a name and choose the weight you want to assign to this goal. Next, add a description of your goal. Describe the
      goal using the SMART methodology– Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic and Timely; or, the X to Y by when. See
      the guidebook for details on creating goals. Add specific actions that you need to take in order for you to achieve
      your goal.</p>
